🥔 Potato Disease Classification (TensorFlow & Keras)

This project is a deep learning model built using TensorFlow and Keras to classify potato leaf diseases from images.

🚀 Features

Image preprocessing (resizing, rescaling, batching)

CNN model for classification

Training, validation, and accuracy/loss visualization

Model saving for later use

Compatible with both .ipynb (interactive) and .py (script) execution

📂 Dataset

This project requires a potato disease dataset. You can use:

PlantVillage Dataset (Kaggle)

Organize your dataset like this:

data/
├── train/
│   ├── Early_Blight/
│   ├── Late_Blight/
│   └── Healthy/
├── val/
│   ├── Early_Blight/
│   ├── Late_Blight/
│   └── Healthy/

📊 Results

Training and validation accuracy plotted

Loss curves for monitoring overfitting

Final model can be exported and used for predictions

📌 Future Improvements

Add data augmentation for better generalization

Deploy model with Streamlit or Flask

Extend to other crop diseases
